                    <h2 id="section1">Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>At Meedgo, we are driven by a clear mission - to revolutionize the way people access healthcare
                        products and services while empowering local pharmacies and connecting communities. Our
                        innovative SAAS (Software-as-a-Service) platform combines the best of online and offline retail,
                        creating a seamless and transparent experience for users.</p>
                    <h2 id="section2">Our Platform</h2>
                    <p>We understand that healthcare is a fundamental need, and finding the right products at affordable
                        prices can be a challenge. That's why we developed Meedgo, a platform that offers live price
                        discovery, allowing users to compare and access the best deals on healthcare articles from a
                        wide range of pharmacies, both online and offline.</p>
                    <h2 id="section3">Empowering Local Pharmacies</h2>
